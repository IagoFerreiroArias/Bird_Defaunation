Match.notes;In crosswalk tabs: Notes on taxonomic matching in the BirdLife-eBird crosswalk. A conservative approach was taken to assigning eBird subspecies or species groups to BirdLife species. In many cases, some specimens of a particular BirdLife taxon can be assigned to an eBird species while other specimens of the same BirdLife taxon can't be assigned because of uncertain provenance (e.g. locality data are ambiguous or lacking). This means that different specimens of individual BirdLife taxa may map onto multiple eBird categories, often including both species and species groups. Notes also highlight cases involving imperfect matches between taxa with the same name but a different allocation of subspecies.;NA;;
